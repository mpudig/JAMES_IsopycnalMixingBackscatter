-- Simulations can be run using the override (and other) files in the 'ConfigFiles' folder. The NeverWorld2 configuration is also useful here: https://github.com/ocean-eddy-cpt/NeverWorld2/releases/tag/v1.1.

-- Figures can be replicated using the files in the 'Figures' folder.

-- A few scripts used in the making of the figures, such as doing the MMT inversion, are available in the 'MiscScripts' folder.
